# Superstore Performance Overview Dashboard

## Overview

This repository hosts an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of Superstore performance metrics. The dashboard is built using a sample dataset available from Tableau's public resources, designed to demonstrate data visualization techniques for sales and profit analysis.

## Dashboard Description

The dashboard features two key visualizations:

- Geographic Map: A choropleth map highlighting profit margins and distinct order counts across various states in the United States. Color gradients represent profit levels, with interactive tooltips for detailed insights.

- Detailed Table: A tabular view breaking down key metrics by state and city, including average discount, quantity sold, sales revenue, profit, distinct order count, and profit per order.

This setup allows users to explore regional performance trends interactively, filtering by managers, states, or cities as needed.
